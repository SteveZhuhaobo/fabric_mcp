# Security and Validation Enhancements Summary

## Overview

Task 10 has been successfully completed, implementing comprehensive security and validation enhancements for the Fabric Lakehouse MCP Server. These enhancements provide multiple layers of protection against security threats, malicious queries, and system abuse.

## Implemented Security Features

### 1. SQL Injection Prevention (`fabric_lakehouse_mcp/security/sql_validator.py`)

**Features:**
- **Multi-level Security**: Configurable security levels (Strict, Moderate, Permissive)
- **Pattern Detection**: Advanced regex patterns to detect SQL injection attempts
- **Dangerous Keywords**: Blocking of system functions and dangerous SQL commands
- **Query Structure Validation**: Validates SQL syntax and structure integrity
- **Function Whitelisting**: Only allows approved SQL functions based on security level

**Key Protections:**
- Stacked query injection (e.g., `SELECT * FROM users; DROP TABLE users;`)
- Comment-based injection attempts
- System function abuse (`xp_cmdshell`, `sp_configure`, etc.)
- Dynamic SQL execution prevention
- Multiple statement blocking

### 2. Query Complexity Analysis (`fabric_lakehouse_mcp/security/query_analyzer.py`)

**Features:**
- **Complexity Scoring**: Weighted scoring system for query complexity
- **Resource Estimation**: Estimates potential resource usage
- **Configurable Limits**: Customizable thresholds for different complexity metrics
- **Detailed Metrics**: Tracks joins, subqueries, CTEs, aggregates, window functions

**Metrics Tracked:**
- JOIN operations count and types
- Subquery nesting levels
- UNION operations
- Aggregate function usage
- Window function complexity
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- WHERE condition complexity
- ORDER BY and GROUP BY column counts

### 3. Comprehensive Audit Logging (`fabric_lakehouse_mcp/security/audit_logger.py`)

**Features:**
- **Structured Logging**: JSON-based audit logs for easy parsing
- **Event Classification**: Different event types (data access, schema changes, security violations)
- **Detailed Context**: Captures user ID, session info, query details, execution metrics
- **Compliance Tags**: Categorizes events for compliance reporting
- **Privacy Protection**: Hashes long queries while preserving audit trail

**Event Types:**
- Data access operations (SELECT queries)
- Data modification operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- Schema access (table listing, schema inspection)
- Schema modifications (CREATE, ALTER, DROP)
- Authentication events
- Authorization failures
- Security violations
- System errors

### 4. Rate Limiting and Request Throttling (`fabric_lakehouse_mcp/security/rate_limiter.py`)

**Features:**
- **Multi-tier Limiting**: Different limits for requests, queries, and operations
- **Sliding Window**: Time-based rate limiting with configurable windows
- **Concurrent Query Control**: Limits simultaneous query execution
- **User Management**: Whitelist/blacklist functionality
- **Burst Allowance**: Configurable burst capacity above normal rates

**Rate Limit Types:**
- Requests per minute/hour
- Queries per minute/hour
- Data operations per minute
- Schema operations per hour
- Concurrent query slots

### 5. Enhanced MCP Tool Integration

**Security Integration:**
- All MCP tools now include comprehensive security checks
- Rate limiting applied before any operation
- SQL validation for all query operations
- Complexity analysis for SELECT queries
- Complete audit trail for all operations
- Security metadata included in responses

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

New security-related environment variables:

```bash
# Security feature toggles
FABRIC_ENABLE_SQL_VALIDATION=true
FABRIC_ENABLE_COMPLEXITY_ANALYSIS=true
FABRIC_ENABLE_RATE_LIMITING=true
FABRIC_ENABLE_AUDIT_LOGGING=true

# Security levels and limits
FABRIC_SQL_SECURITY_LEVEL=moderate  # strict, moderate, permissive
FABRIC_MAX_COMPLEXITY_SCORE=100
FABRIC_MAX_CONCURRENT_QUERIES=5
FABRIC_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE=100
FABRIC_QUERIES_PER_MINUTE=50
```

### Security Levels

**Strict Mode:**
- Maximum security with aggressive pattern detection
- Blocks many advanced SQL features
- Suitable for high-security environments

**Moderate Mode (Default):**
- Balanced security and functionality
- Allows most legitimate queries while blocking obvious threats
- Recommended for most production environments

**Permissive Mode:**
- Minimal security checks
- Allows advanced SQL features
- Suitable for trusted development environments

## Files Created/Modified

### New Security Module Files:
- `fabric_lakehouse_mcp/security/__init__.py`
- `fabric_lakehouse_mcp/security/sql_validator.py`
- `fabric_lakehouse_mcp/security/query_analyzer.py`
- `fabric_lakehouse_mcp/security/audit_logger.py`
- `fabric_lakehouse_mcp/security/rate_limiter.py`

### Modified Files:
- `fabric_lakehouse_mcp/tools/mcp_tools.py` - Integrated all security features
- `fabric_lakehouse_mcp/server.py` - Updated initialization to pass config
- `fabric_lakehouse_mcp/config/settings.py` - Added security configuration
- `fabric_lakehouse_mcp/models/data_models.py` - Enhanced validation

### Test Files:
- `tests/test_security_enhancements.py` - Comprehensive security tests

## Security Benefits

### Protection Against:
- **SQL Injection**: Multiple layers of injection detection and prevention
- **Resource Abuse**: Query complexity limits prevent resource exhaustion
- **Rate Abuse**: Comprehensive rate limiting prevents system overload
- **Unauthorized Access**: Detailed audit logging for compliance and monitoring
- **System Compromise**: Blocking of dangerous system functions and commands

### Compliance Features:
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all data access and modifications
- **Access Control**: Rate limiting and user management capabilities
- **Data Protection**: Query validation prevents data exfiltration attempts
- **Monitoring**: Real-time security event logging and alerting

## Performance Impact

The security enhancements are designed to be lightweight:
- **SQL Validation**: Minimal overhead using efficient regex patterns
- **Complexity Analysis**: Fast query parsing with configurable limits
- **Rate Limiting**: In-memory sliding window counters
- **Audit Logging**: Asynchronous logging to minimize query impact

## Testing

Comprehensive test suite covers:
- SQL injection prevention scenarios
- Query complexity analysis edge cases
- Rate limiting behavior under load
- Audit logging accuracy and completeness
- Integration with existing MCP tools

## Requirements Satisfied

This implementation satisfies all requirements from task 10:

✅ **SQL injection prevention measures** - Comprehensive multi-layer protection
✅ **Query complexity analysis and restrictions** - Detailed complexity scoring and limits
