# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides seamless integration with Microsoft Fabric Lakehouse. The server will enable users to inspect data structures, create new tables, and execute SQL queries against the Lakehouse through a standardized MCP interface. This will allow AI assistants and other MCP clients to interact with Fabric Lakehouse data programmatically.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to connect to Microsoft Fabric Lakehouse through an MCP server, so that I can access my data warehouse from AI tools and applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MCP server is started THEN it SHALL establish a connection to Microsoft Fabric Lakehouse using proper authentication
2. WHEN authentication fails THEN the server SHALL return appropriate error messages and retry mechanisms
3. WHEN the connection is established THEN the server SHALL expose MCP tools for data operations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to inspect the data structure of my Lakehouse, so that I can understand what tables and schemas are available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I call the list_tables tool THEN the server SHALL return all available tables in the Lakehouse
2. WHEN I call the describe_table tool with a table name THEN the server SHALL return the table schema including column names, types, and constraints
3. WHEN I request schema information for a non-existent table THEN the server SHALL return an appropriate error message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want to create new tables in the Lakehouse, so that I can set up data structures for new projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I call the create_table tool with valid table definition THEN the server SHALL create the table in the Lakehouse
2. WHEN I provide invalid table schema THEN the server SHALL return validation errors before attempting creation
3. WHEN table creation fails due to permissions or conflicts THEN the server SHALL return descriptive error messages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to execute SQL queries against the Lakehouse, so that I can retrieve and analyze data programmatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I call the execute_query tool with a SELECT statement THEN the server SHALL return query results in a structured format
2. WHEN I execute INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statements THEN the server SHALL return the number of affected rows
3. WHEN a query has syntax errors THEN the server SHALL return the error details from Fabric Lakehouse
4. WHEN query execution times out THEN the server SHALL handle the timeout gracefully and return appropriate messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the MCP server to handle authentication securely, so that access to the Lakehouse is properly controlled.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server starts THEN it SHALL support multiple authentication methods (service principal, managed identity, interactive)
2. WHEN authentication credentials are invalid THEN the server SHALL not expose any data operation tools
3. WHEN authentication tokens expire THEN the server SHALL automatically refresh them when possible

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and logging, so that I can troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any operation fails THEN the server SHALL log detailed error information
2. WHEN network connectivity issues occur THEN the server SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
3. WHEN the server encounters unexpected errors THEN it SHALL return user-friendly error messages while logging technical details
